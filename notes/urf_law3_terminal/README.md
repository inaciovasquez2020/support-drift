# URF_law3 terminal obstruction note

This note records a terminal obstruction: FO^k-local (bounded-radius) expansion hypotheses do not imply a global spectral gap.
Counterexample: two bounded-degree expanders joined by a single edge. Global Cheeger constant and spectral gap go to 0 while every FO^k-local region has uniformly positive expansion.

Status: negative result / obstruction note.
