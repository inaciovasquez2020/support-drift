Support Drift — Formal Statement
Informal name
Support Drift Principle
Domain
Finite combinatorial or statistical objects equipped with a notion of local support, a refinement or update process, and a bounded information or capacity constraint.
Core claim (structural form)
Let X be a finite configuration space and let S_t ⊆ X denote the effective support of a refinement process at step t.
Under bounded per-step information gain and absence of a global stabilizing invariant, the sequence (S_t) cannot remain stationary.
Formally, there exists T such that S_{t+T} ≠ S_t for all sufficiently large t.
Equivalently, persistent local refinement forces drift in global support.
Scope
The claim is qualitative, invariant-based, and does not assert rates, optimality, convergence, or universality.
