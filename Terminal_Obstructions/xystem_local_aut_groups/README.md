## Executive Summary

This module proves a terminal impossibility result for all frameworks
attempting to derive **global algebraic structure from local symmetry**
via bounded-support automorphism groups on infinite graphs.

In particular, it shows that the core object underlying XYSTEM and related
approaches — the local automorphism group Γ₀(R) — is algebraically
incapable of supporting any finite, canonical, or functorial presentation
theory.

As a consequence, all locality-based holonomy, presentation-transfer,
and local-to-global rigidity principles in this regime are **mathematically impossible**.

## Main Theorem (Informal)

Let G be any infinite bounded-degree graph and define:

Γ₀(R) = { σ ∈ Aut(G) | supp(σ) ⊆ B_R(x) for some x ∈ V(G) }

Then:

Γ₀(R) ≅ ⨁_{x ∈ V(G)} Sym(B_R(x))

That is, Γ₀(R) is an infinite direct sum of finite symmetric groups.

## Immediate Consequences

For every fixed R ≥ 1:

Γ₀(R) is:
- infinite-rank
- locally finite
- not finitely generated
- not finitely presented
- admits no finite Dehn function
- admits no canonical generating set
- admits no functorial structure
- admits no holonomy construction
- admits no presentation transfer from local data

## What This Refutes

This result formally refutes the entire class of frameworks based on:

- XYSTEM  
- Local Presentation Lemma (LPL)  
- Holonomy from links  
- Functorial relator extraction  
- Garland-style local-to-global spectral propagation  
- CAT(0) curvature lifting from neighborhoods  
- Any "local rigidity implies global structure" principle
  using bounded-support automorphism groups on infinite graphs

These are not open problems.  
They are **structurally impossible**.

## Why the Obstruction Is Final

The obstruction is not technical, analytic, or probabilistic.

It is purely algebraic:

Γ₀(R) is an infinite direct sum of finite groups.

Such groups:
- cannot be finitely generated
- cannot be finitely presented
- cannot support canonical generators
- cannot admit compact CW models
- cannot carry functorial invariants

No additional assumptions, geometry, or higher structure can fix this.
