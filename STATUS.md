Claim status — Support Drift
Current status
The Support Drift Principle is a structural hypothesis.
It is conceptually motivated, empirically observed in bounded experiments, and consistent with known capacity and refinement obstructions.
It is not formally proved in full generality and not claimed beyond bounded or synthetic instances.
Evidence in this repository
Bounded enumerations, synthetic examples, and invariant-tracking scripts.
These constitute evidence, not proof.
Boundary
All results in this repository should be interpreted as evidence for support drift under stated constraints, not as general impossibility or convergence theorems.
Upgrade path
To elevate this claim to a theorem, one must supply a precise definition of support, a capacity or entropy bound, a formal refinement model, and a contradiction or pumping argument.
